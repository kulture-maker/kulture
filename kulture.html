    The prosperous land of Kumandra is ravaged by Druun, threatening evil spirits that petrify people and dragons. Sisu, the last dragon, concentrates her magic into a gem and banishes the Druun, reviving Kumandra's people but not the dragons. A power struggle for the gem divides Kumandra's people into five tribes, based on their placement along with a giant, dragon-shaped river: Fang, Heart, Spine, Talon, and Tail.[12]
<br>

<br>
Five hundred years later, Chief Benja of the Heart tribe trains his daughter Raya to protect the gem. Firmly believing that the tribes can be united once again, Benja decides to hold a feast for the leadership of all five tribes. During the feast, Raya befriends Namaari, the daughter of Chief Virana of the Fang tribe, who gives Raya a dragon pendant as a gift. Trusting her, Raya shows Namaari the location of the gem, but Namaari betrays Raya as part of a plot to help Fang steal it. Alerted to the attack, Benja and the other tribes arrive at the scene and start fighting over the gem, which gets broken in the scuffle. As each tribe steals a piece of the gem, the Druun reawaken and overtake Heart and its people before spreading throughout the rest of Kumandra.

<br>
For the next six years, Raya treks across Kumandra to find Sisu to help her recover the four missing pieces. After reaching a shipwreck in Tail, Raya finally manages to summon Sisu, who admits that she did not create the gem, but rather on behalf of her four siblings, with each piece containing each enchanter's power. Sisu's disguised as an extraordinary human as Raya has insisted until she revealed herself to save Raya from Namaari at Spine, where the group recovered their final dragon gem piece excluding Fang.

<br>
During the group's journey to Fang, Sisu manages to convince Raya to ally with Namaari rather than stealing the final piece, she decided to return Namaari the dragon pendant as a peace offering she gave to her years ago. Namaari, torn by her responsibility to save Fang's reputation and her wish to help defeat the Druun, threatens to shoot them with a crossbow upon seeing the gem pieces. Sisu tries to calm Namaari down but is fatally shot when Raya lashes her sword on Namaari's crossbow.

<br>
Sisu's death causes all the water to disappear from Fang's protective canal, allowing the Druun to overrun the realm. Raya enters to confront Namaari, whom she finds to be mourning over the petrification of her mother. The two fight while Raya's companions rescue the people of Fang using the gem pieces. Raya bests Namaari and prepares to kill her, but stops upon realizing her fault in Sisu's death due to her inability to trust others and heads off to aid the group instead.

<br>
Namaari follows Raya with Fang’s piece and saves Raya’s pet Tuk Tuk from being petrified, thus Raya forgives Namaari. As the Druun gain on Raya's group, Raya, remembering how trust allowed Sisu to save the world beforehand, urges the others to unite and reassemble the gem, showing her faith towards Namaari by handing over her piece and allowing the Druun to take her. The rest follow suit, with Namaari assembling the gem before the Druun petrifies her as well. With the gem reassembled because of trust, the Druun again are vanquished with all their victims revived, including the dragons. The group reunites with their lost loved ones and reunited as Kumandra.
